- It is very easy to search the weather details of any city.
- It privides various background images based on the time & date.
- It uses APIs such API Ninjas & IP Info.

## Tech Used

I have used these following tech for building the cityWebCast WebApp:

- [HTMl]() - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [CSS]() - Used for styling the website.
- [Javascript]() - Used JS to make things functional.
- [Bootstrap]() - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [API by API Ninjas]() - Feached the weather details.
- [API by IP Info]() - Used for tracing IP Information of the user.


And of course citiWebCast  is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/vishanurag/cityWebCast) on GitHub.

## Installation

Because citiWebCast WebApp is build using simple technologies, this doesn't requires any Installation at all.

- Just run the index.html file to see the output.
- But you need to add your own API Key from API NINJAS & API Token from IP Info.
- Without the API keys & tokens you will not be able to use it in your local machine.
